## Abstract
The Atlantic Equatorial Mode, also known as the Atlantic Niño, is a climate pattern characterized by warming sea surface temperatures (SST) in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. This work aims to characterize the observational mode of the Atlantic Niño and compare it with El Niño to identify their differences. The study analyse the monthly variability, spatial distributions, and relationships between sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies and precipitation anomalies of both climate patterns over 61 years, using data from 1960 to 2020.

## Introduction

The Pacific and Atlantic Oceans both have their unique
weather patterns and climate phenomena. One of the most
well-known is the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in
the Pacific Ocean.
 El Niño-Southern Oscillation is a climate pattern
that refers to the fluctuations in sea surface
temperature (SST) and air pressure between the
ocean and atmosphere in the east-central
Equatorial Pacific. The ENSO has anomalies
peak between November and January with an
amplitude around 1.2°C and is located in Niño
3.4 region (between 5°N and 5°S latitude and
120°W and 170°W longitude [1]).
 The Atlantic Niño is a climate pattern similar to
the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) but it
takes place in the Atlantic Ocean, specifically in
the tropical Atlantic Ocean. The Atlantic Niño is
characterized by warming the sea surface
temperature (SST) in the eastern equatorial basin
[2]. The Atlantic Niño has anomalies peak
between July and August with an amplitude
around 0.6°C and is located in the ATL3 region
(between 3°N and 3°S latitude and 20°W and
0°E longitude [3]).
The SST anomalies lead to changes in wind patterns and
ocean currents. These changes affect global weather patterns
and can lead to extreme weather conditions such as droughts,
floods, and hurricanes in various regions around the world.
The Pacific Niño may have an influence on the Atlantic Niño
formation because it usually induces a Walker circulation
that extends the anomalies towards the Atlantic [4]. Positive
anomalies cause a decrease in atmospheric pressure in that
area and therefore weaken the trade winds over the equatorial
Atlantic in spring. The weakening of the trade winds causes
higher temperatures in the equatorial Atlantic, further
weakening the trade winds, this effect is known as the
Bjerknes feedback.
